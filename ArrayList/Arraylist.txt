Java ArrayList

In java we need to declare the size of an array before we can 
use it. Once the size of an array is declared it's hard to change 
it.
To handle this issue we can use the arraylist class. it allows
us to create resizeable arrays.
Unlike arrays arraylist can automatically adjust their capacity
when we add or remove elements from them. Hence ArrayList are also 
known as dynamic arrays.

Internal Working of ArrayList

Initially, the array has a certain capacity, and as elements
are added it fills up.When the capacity is reached, the ArrayList
creates a new larger array and copies the elements from the old
array to the new one.This process of resizing and copying is transparent
to the user.

However frequent resizing operations can lead to performance overhead
so the arraylist increases its capacity by a certain factor to 
minimize the frequency of resizing.

formula
10*3=30/2 = 15+1=16

Java LinkedList

The LinkedList class of the java collections framework provides
the functionality of the Linked List data structure(doubly LinkedList).
Elements in LinkedList are not stored in sequence. Instead they are
scattered and connected through links(Prev and Next).
