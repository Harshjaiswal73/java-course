Java ArrayList
in java we need to declare the size of an array before we can 
use it. Once the size of an array is declared it's hard to change 
it.
To handle this issue we can use the arraylist class. it allows
us to create resizeable arrays.
Unlike arrays arraylist can automatically adjust their capacity
when we add or remove elements from them. Hence ArrayList are also 
known as dynamic arrays.
