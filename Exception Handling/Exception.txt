Java Exceptions
=> An Exceptions is an unexpected events that occurs 
   during program execution. It affects the flow of the 
   program instruction which can cause the program to terminate
   abnormally.


An Exceptions can occur for many reasons. Some of them are:
  >Invalid user input
  >Device failure
  >Loss of network Connections
  >Physical Limitations (out of disk memory)
  >Code errors
  >Opening an unavailable file 

Java Runtime Exceptions
=> A runtime exception happens due to a programming error. 
They are also known as uncheked exceptions.
These exception are not checked at compile-time but run-time
Some of the common runtime exception are:
 
 > Null pointer acess(Missing the initialization of a varriable)
   NullPointerExcetion
 > Out-of-bounds array access - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
 > Dividing a number by 0 -Arithmetic Exceptions

You can think about it in this way. "If it is a runtime exception
it is your fault.

Java IoException Exceptions
=> An IoException is also known as a checked Exceptions. They
are checked by the compiler at the compile-time and the programmer 
is prompted to handle these exception.
Some of the examples of checked exception are:
>Trying to open a file that doesn't exist result in FileNotFoundException
> Trying to read past the end of a file

try-catch block
=> the try catch block in java is used to handle exception and prevents the abnormal 
termination of the program.

try-catch-finally block
=> in java we can also use the finally block after the try catch block
in this case the finally block is always executed whether there is an exception
inside the try block or not.
It is a good practice to use finally block to include important cleanup code 
like closing a file or connection.
Note> There are some cases when a finally block does not execute:
> Use of System.exit() method
> An exception occurs in the finally block
> the death of a thread

java throw and throws
=> we use the throws keyword in the method declaration to declare the type of exception
that might occur within it. 

=> the throw keyword is used to explicitly throw a single exception.

======================= Generics and Wrapper Classes ========
Wrapper Classes:-
A Wrapper class in java is a class whose object wraps or contains
primitive data types.When we create an object to a wrapper class
it contains a field and in this field we can store primitive 
data types.
